## Comments
### What I did
- Field is an input, so you can type with keyboard
- Plus sign left to input opens complex operators
- Limited number size for input
- After equal next number will reset input, but operators won't
### What I could change/what doesn't work
- Factorial, ln, e, pi not operational
- Css not polished at all
- Complex operators don't work with normal operations following them ( sin(a)-b doesn't work)
- Keypress on Enter is not yet implemented
